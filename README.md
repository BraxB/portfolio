# 02 Portfolio

## The Repository

This repository (Portfolio) relates to my portfolio website. Instructions in following user story section below were included. 

In this version 2 I have fixed some of the styling errors I had made in the first version. The site now functions much smoother on mobile devices as well and I fixed some issues with distorted images.

Technologies used include HTML, CSS, and bootstrap. There is another version of the application using React, however I decided I have decided to use this version instead as the design of the portfolio was simple enough that it did not necessarily need the introduction of React.

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
